# Guiding Projects to a Successful Global Sprint

Thanks for helping guide projects at the Globa Sprint! You'll be helping Project Leads prepare to welcome and encourage new contributions on their projects from a wide range of Sprint participants with varied background and skills. You'll help:

* Encourage projects from your community to register for the Sprint!
* Review project documentation and suggest edits/changes (as needed) to make materials more contributor-friendly
* Answer any Sprint related questions Project Leads may have

Start by familiarizing yourself with the [Project Lead info](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/projects/) and [Project Requirements](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/project-requirements/) for the 2018 Sprint. 

### Workflow for Project Registration and Preparation
1. Project Lead (PL) fills out the [project submission form](https://goo.gl/forms/lvzjKt981TK9P3XQ2). Form includes box to check for Internet Health association/connection.
2. PL receives email with link to issue template & checklist. Designated Project Guide (PG) is automatically cc'ed. 
3. PL makes issue; PG is tagged automatically to be notified of the new issue.
4. PG reviews issue, and add labels for tracks, comments and answers questions as needed. 
5. If/when PL completes checklist to be featured project and creates Pulse submission, PG adds project to Network Pulse with Global Sprint tags.

#### Using labels
Encourage Project Leads to use labels that will help contributors find projects that match both their content interest and their skillset. For example, "help wanted:design" "help wanted:javascript" "help wanted:copyediting" 

#### Posting to Mozilla Pulse
Once the project lead posts `This is ready for Mozilla Pulse`, check that they have completed all the steps to be a FEATURED project. If all's in order, [post the project to Mozilla Pulse](https://www.mozillapulse.org/add).

* **Title** Use the title of the issue
* **URL** If the project has a landing page, add that here. Otherwise, link to the GitHub repo.
* **Description** Use the description the project lead provided - it should be in the first (top) comment of the issue.
* **Creator(s)** Add the project lead name(s)
* **Why might this be interesting to other people in our network?** Add your own thoughts here. Feel free to leave blank.
* **Tags** Add the tags `mozsprint` and `2018`  **!!! < THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT !!!!**
* **Key Internet Issues** Add the issues the project lead indiciated. Feel free to curate if you think another issue is better.
* **Looking for support?...** Add text similar to "If you're interested in contributing to this project jump in on the GitHub repository now or join us during #mozsprint June 1-2, 2017!" Feel free to remix!
* **Link for people to get involved.** Add a link to the `mozsprint` label on GitHub. It should be `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/labels/mozsprint`
* **Project image** Upload the image the project lead provided on the issue

#### How to reassign a project
If you think a project is better suited for another community, tag another wrangler in the comments.

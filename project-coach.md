# Coaching Projects to a Successful Global Sprint

Thanks for helping coach projects at the Globa Sprint! You'll be helping Project Leads prepare to welcome and encourage new contributions on their projects from a wide range of Sprint participants with varied background and skills. You'll help:

* Encourage projects from your community to register for the Sprint!
* Review project documentation and suggest edits/changes (as needed) to make materials more contributor-friendly
* Answer any Sprint related questions Project Leads may have

Start by familiarizing yourself with the [Project Lead info](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/projects/) and [Project Requirements](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/project-requirements/) for the 2018 Sprint. 

### Workflow for Project Registration and Preparation
1. Project Lead (PL) fills out the [project submission form](https://goo.gl/forms/lvzjKt981TK9P3XQ2). Form includes box to check for Internet Health association/connection.
2. PL receives email with link to issue template & checklist. Designated Project Coach (PC) is automatically cc'ed. 
3. PL creates the issue in the main global sprint reop. This issue is the project's entry in the index of projects in the Sprint. PC is tagged automatically and notified of the new issue.
4. PC reviews issue, adds labels for tracks, comments and answers questions as needed. Note that this issue should link to a project-specific repo where Sprint work will take place.  
5. PC reviews project-specific repo, scans for any possible barriers to entry, such as overuse of jargon, poor or confusing documentation, lack of good "first bugs" or clear instruction on how to get involved. Also keep an eye out for lingering placeholder text from the GH template that project leads forked. All text should be project specfic!
6. PC provides feedback to PL to revise documentation as needed-- this can be done in GH issues. 
7. If/when PL completes checklist to be featured project and creates Pulse submission, PC adds project to Network Pulse with Global Sprint tags, or pings a Mozilla staff moderator do so. 
8. When the project is complete and featured, PC encourages PL to remove the preparation check-list from their issue in the GS repo, so the issue is now bright, shiny and contributor facing! 

### Featured Projects on Pulse
An featured project is one that's been reviewed for documetation and will appear at the top of the list The following information must be included in any Pulse listing-- ensure that this information is complete before approving any submission! It is OK to lighty edit the Pulse listing for grammar or clarity if needed. If see a need for major edits, communicate with the PL about them.

* **Title** Use the title of the issue
* **URL** If the project has a landing page, it goes here. Otherwise, link to the GitHub repo.
* **Description** A clear and concise description of the project
* **Creator(s)** Project lead name(s)
* **Why might this be interesting to other people in our network?** This field is important-- it will help contributors see where they fit in! 
* **Tags** Add the tags `mozsprint` and `2018`  **!!! < THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT !!!!**
* **Key Internet Issues** OK to add multiple issue tags.
* **Looking for support?...** Ensure that this say ssomething like  "If you're interested in contributing to this project jump in on the GitHub repository now or join us during #mozsprint May 11 & 12, 2017!" 
* **Link for people to get involved.** Add a link to the `mozsprint` label on GitHub, or better yet-- to the project readme on the project-specific repository. 
* **Project image** check that image is properly sized

#### Using labels
Project coaches encourage Project Leads to use labels that will help contributors find projects that match both their content interest and their skillset. For example, "help wanted:design" "help wanted:javascript" "help wanted:copyediting". You can add these lables in the main gitHub repo and encourage leads to add them to their issues in the project-specific repo. 

#### How to reassign a project
If you think a project is better suited for another community, tag another Coach in the comments.

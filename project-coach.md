# Coaching Projects to a Successful Global Sprint

Thanks for helping coach projects at the Globa Sprint! You'll be helping Project Leads prepare to welcome and encourage new contributions on their projects from a wide range of Sprint participants with varied background and skills. You'll help:

* Encourage projects from your community to register for the Sprint!
* Review project documentation and suggest edits/changes (as needed) to make materials more contributor-friendly
* Answer any Sprint related questions Project Leads may have

Start by familiarizing yourself with the [Project Lead info](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/projects/) and [Project Requirements](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/project-requirements/) for the 2018 Sprint. 

As you know, a great README and good contributor guidelines and a clear license are key to building strong, active open projects-- so a thorough documentation review of all Sprint projects is very important! 

Many projects that are new to GitHub and the Sprint may have forked a template repo that we provided, and that template is filled with placeholder text. It's **really important** that this text is replaced with project specific text, throughout the repo! This is one of the things you should look for when reviewing project documentation. As Project Coach, you'll likely work with a few different leads in the run-up to the Sprint. The steps that Project Leads will take, and how you as a Coach can help them-- are listed below.


### Workflow for Project Registration and Preparation
1. Project Lead (Lead) fills out the [project submission form](https://goo.gl/forms/lvzjKt981TK9P3XQ2). Form includes box to check for Internet Health association/connection.
2. Lead receives email with link to issue template & checklist. Designated Project Coach (Coach) is automatically cc'ed. 
3. Lead creates the issue in the main global sprint repository. This issue is the project's entry in the index of projects in the Sprint. Coach is tagged automatically and notified of the new issue.
4. Coach reviews issue, adds labels for tracks, comments and answers questions as needed. Note that this issue should link to a **project-specific repo** where Sprint work will take place.  
5. Coach reviews project-specific repo, scans for any possible barriers to entry, such as overuse of jargon, poor or confusing documentation, lack of good "first bugs" or clear instruction on how to get involved. **Also keep an eye out for lingering placeholder text from the GH template that project leads forked. All text should be project specfic!**
6. Coach provides feedback to PL to revise documentation as needed-- this can be done in GH issues. 
7. If/when Lead completes checklist to be featured project, Lead creates a Pulse listing using the Pulse submission form (link in Leads's issue checklist). Lead should add the tags `mozsprint` and `2018`, and any relevant interent health tags
8. Once the listing is submitted, the Coach reviews the listing (see below, for tips on reviewing) and approves project in Mozilla Pulse or pings a Mozilla staff moderator do so. 
9. When the project is complete and featured, Coach encourages Lead to **remove the preparation check-list from their issue in the GS repo, so the issue is now bright, shiny and contributor facing!**

### Featured Projects on Pulse
A featured project is one that's been reviewed for documetation and shows up in Mozilla Pulse!
To moderate on Mozilla Pulse you'll need to log-in. A moderation option should appear at top right on your page.
PLEASE **ONLY** MODERATE PULSE LISTINGS FOR PROJECTS YOU ARE COACHING! Do not take any action on any other listings. 

The following information must be included in any Pulse listing-- ensure that this information is complete before approving any submission. Use the list below to check each submission before you approve it:

* **Title** Use the title of the project
* **URL** If the project has a landing page, it goes here. Otherwise, link to the README in your project repo
* **Description** A clear and concise description of the project
* **Creator(s)** Project lead name(s)
* **Why might this be interesting to other people in our network?** This field is important-- it will help contributors see where they fit in! 
* **Key Internet Issues** OK to add multiple issue tags.
* **Tags** `mozsprint` and `2018` are required!
* **Project Image** Having an image really helps! Encourage leads to add an image
* **Looking for support?...** They should list specific ways people can help, like "logo design" or "javascript coding." Also  select the top three asks for help from the list below.  
* **Link for people to get involved.** -link to the README or coontributor Guidelines in the project's repository. 
* **Project image** check that image is properly sized

Use the dropdown menu to approve. And that's it!

#### Using labels
Coaches encourage Leads to use labels that will help contributors find projects that match both their content interest and their skillset. For example, Coaches should ensure that tags like "help wanted:design" "help wanted:coding" "help wanted:documentation" are added to the project issue in the main Global Sprint repo. 

Also encourage Leads to add these labels, or more specific ones like "help wanted: javascript" to their individual issues in their own project-specific repos. THe goal here is to make it as easy as possible for contributors to find work to do!

#### How to reassign a project
If you feel very storongly that a project is better suited for another issue, tag another Coach in the comments, and cc zee-moz and acabunoc in that comment.
